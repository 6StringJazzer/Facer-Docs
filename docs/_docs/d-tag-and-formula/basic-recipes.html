      <h2>Width-Based Battery Indicator Bar</h2>
      <p>There are many ways to create a custom battery indicator, but one of the easiest is to use a shape &amp; the width property to show the battery level for a watch or phone.</p>

      <p>
        While we provide essential elements for analog time, you might have an idea that makes a second/minute/hour hand out of a different element altogether (rotating text, shape, cat with laser eyes, etc). This recipe will show you how to rotate any element based on the time. For our example we use 'seconds': <code>#DWFSS#</code>, but you could also use a different <a href="/tags">tag</a>.

      <h2>Back &amp; Forth Motion</h2>
     
      <p>
        You can use the sine &amp; cosine functions to make back &amp; forth movement, as demonstrated by this laser cat's tongue:
