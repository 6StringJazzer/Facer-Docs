<p>Background elements are simple elements that are always included in your watch face, and stay at the bottom of your layers.</p>

<div class="card"><h2>Background Image</h2>
	<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/background-image.png" alt="Background Image Icon"/>
	<p>The background image is similar to the custom 'image' element, except that it is always in your layer stack. This element allows advanced settings and tags to allow for dynamic backgrounds.</p>
</div>

<div class="card"><h2>Background Color</h2>
	<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/background-color.png" alt="Background Color Icon"/>
	<p>The background color is the default color that will be shown to a user if there are no other layers on top.</p>
</div>
