        <h2>Avatars</h2>
        <p>Make sure you have an avatar set, otherwise the default will show. It's a good idea to just have your brand/logo as the image. It also shows up when people view your profile on web and mobile. </p>

        <p>Good watch face design typically has a few characteristics, just like app design. They are focused, have a clear hierarchy and have great color harmony. Keep all of those in mind when designing.</p>

  <h2>Watchface Checklist</h2>
  <ul>
<li>Do you have a DIM mode? when DIM mode is active it should be either pure black and pure white to display well on all watchfaces. Here is an example<br>

<strong class="clear">Active mode with full color</strong><br>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/DIM active.png" class="medium">

<strong class="clear">Black and white DIM mode</strong><br>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/DIM inactive.png" class="medium">
</li>

<li>Dim mode includes the time</li>
<li>Are your fonts readable and big enough?</li>
<li>If itâ€™s analog, is there enough contrast between watch hands and the background?</li>
All features that are included are working as intended (weather, location, time, step count, battery, etc)</li>
<li>If the watchface has digital elements the #Db# tag should be used so that the user can later choose their preference. </li>
<li>If animation is advertised in the product description, it functions as intended/stated</li>
</ul>

<h2>Design specs</h2>
<p>Canvas is 640 x 640px at 72 dpi/ppi. You might also want to consider that some watches have a chin at the bottom which would hide any design elements that would be down there on selected models. 
The editor also gives an option to preview the chin with the leftmost button, which is located right below canvas preview</p>

<p>Make sure you design for both square and circle.</p> 
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/timeless1.png" class="medium">
<p>You can do this by clicking advanced button on an image layer <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/advanced mode.png"> and then uploading different images for square and circle.</p>

<h2>Best Practices</h2>

<h3>Crisp Design</h3>

<p>When designing in Photoshop/Illustrator or other programs, make sure you are always locking to pixels and on even numbers. Also make sure the minimum pixel stroke is 2px.</p>

<h3>Incorrect</h3>

<h3>Good performance</h3>

<p>Make sure all your layers are compressed into a single layer if they are part of the background. The less layers you have the quicker it will sync and smoother it will run.</p>

<h3>Keep it on brand</h3>

<p>When adding a description make sure you are selling the watch and not the features. We handle most of the features in the user interface so you should stay focused on why you made the watch and why the user will want to wear it. For example "This is a watchface any SCI-FI lover will like. Feel like you are in the driver's seat of a spaceship"</p>
